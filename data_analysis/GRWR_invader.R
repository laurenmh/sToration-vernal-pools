#Goal: Calculate the long-term growth rate when rare (r_invader) of LACO 

#Step 1. Calculate the stable equilibrium frequency of non-LACO species in the model each year. 
#Step 2. Calculate the annual growth rate of LACO in restored pools when one LACO is introduced a stable community. 
#Step 3. Do the same step for the reference pools.
#Step 4. Average the growth rates of LACO over time for restored and reference pools.
