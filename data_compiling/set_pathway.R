## Set data pathways! Do this manually, the first pathway for Macs, the second for PCs

# Do this at the beginning of the workflow and the rest should be all standardized

# If you have a Mac, run this line:
datpath <- "~/Dropbox/sToration/VP_data/"

#LGS pathway 
# datpath <- "~/Dropbox/Shared/sToration/VP_data/"

# If you have a PC, create your own version below and run it

datpath <- "C:/Users/Lina/sToration/VP_data/"

# AMF pathway
# datpath <- "C:/Users/akash/Dropbox/sToration/VP_data/"

##LL pathway
#datpath <- "C:/Users/llari/Dropbox/sToration/VP_data/"

# LA pathway
datpath <- "C:/Users/Lina/Dropbox/sToration/VP_data/"
